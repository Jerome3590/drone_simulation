### Non-Linear Time Series Forecasting

Truck shipments are tied to operational schedules, equipment life cycles, and funding cycles. To capture the holistic structure of what is influencing our forecast we are using non-linear time series forecasting.

Non-linear forecasting works by capturing the non-linear, cyclic patterns of the time series via embedding parameters (i.e. theta, rho) and then predicting future events based on these parameters.

For our use case we value not just an accurate forecast number but the accurate timing of peak and non-peak demands. We do not want a forecast that has great accuracy simply because it lags behind the latest observation. We value or weigh heavily on the forecast that is ahead of the curve rather than lagging behind.

We will select the forecast that gives us the best forecast accuracy as well as the best match to peak and non-peak demands.

### Embedding Dimension

```{r rho-e}

rho_E <- EmbedDimension(dataFrame = trucks_ts, columns = "Trucks", target = "Trucks", lib = "1 1063", pred = "1064 1079", showPlot = TRUE)

rho_E

```


## Test Various Model Configurations

simplex_out10 <- Simplex(dataFrame = trucks_ts, lib = "1 1064", pred = "1064 1079", columns = "Trucks", target = "Trucks", E = 10)

ComputeError(simplex_out10 $ Predictions, simplex_out10 $ Observations)

```


```{r simplex-embedding-7}

### We want the model that best approximates when peak and non-peak trucks/day will happen with forecasted amount. CAS data does not include the Carriers that have base access (ie. FEDEX/DHL/USPS). We will have to add a best guess estimate (~5 for peak days, ~1 for non-peak days) on top of our chosen forecast to capture what we believe the total forecast to be. Upon visual inspection we select the SMAP nonlinear model with Embedding Dimension=7 and Theta=4 as our base forecast model.
